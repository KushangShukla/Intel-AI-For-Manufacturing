# Assignment 07 – Computer Vision Use Cases in Manufacturing

This assignment explores real-world applications of computer vision in the manufacturing industry. It presents three use cases, each with a structured project plan including the problem statement, proposed AI-based solution, potential impact, and relevant ethical or legal considerations.

---

## 🧠 Objective

To identify and define three impactful use cases where computer vision can be applied in manufacturing, along with strategic implementation plans.

## 📸 Use Case Summaries

### 1. **Defective Product Detection**
- **Problem:** Manual inspection is error-prone and inconsistent.
- **Solution:** Train a vision model to identify surface anomalies, cracks, and misalignments.
- **Impact:** Increases quality control accuracy, reduces waste.
- **Considerations:** Requires diverse training data; real-time feedback loops.

### 2. **Worker Safety Monitoring**
- **Problem:** Lack of compliance with safety protocols (e.g., helmets, vests).
- **Solution:** Use real-time object/person detection models to enforce safety gear usage.
- **Impact:** Reduces workplace accidents, improves compliance tracking.
- **Considerations:** Privacy, consent for employee surveillance.

### 3. **Predictive Maintenance via Visual Inspection**
- **Problem:** Unexpected downtime due to worn-out parts.
- **Solution:** Monitor machines visually for signs of degradation (e.g., rust, cracks).
- **Impact:** Enables scheduled maintenance, avoids failure.
- **Considerations:** Need for accurate image annotation and hardware infrastructure.
