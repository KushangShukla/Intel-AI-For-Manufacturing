## 🎯 Key Benefits of RPA in Manufacturing

1. **Improved Accuracy**  
   - Minimizes manual errors in invoice processing, data entry, and reporting.

2. **Faster Operations**  
   - Reduces turnaround time for repetitive tasks like part ordering and inventory updates.

3. **Cost Efficiency**  
   - Saves time and resources, allowing reallocation of human effort to higher-value activities.

4. **Compliance and Audit Readiness**  
   - Automatically maintains audit trails and ensures policy compliance.

5. **Scalability**  
   - Easily scales across departments and integrates with existing ERP systems.

## 📊 Instructional Pitch Points

1. Identify 3–5 high-impact processes suitable for automation (e.g., vendor onboarding, purchase order tracking).
2. Map current manual workflows and estimate time/cost involved.
3. Demonstrate how RPA bots can replicate these workflows with zero errors.
4. Present estimated ROI (e.g., time savings per month, error reduction, cost avoided).
5. Address change management and employee re-skilling strategy.
