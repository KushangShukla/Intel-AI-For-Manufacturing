## 🧰 Toolbox Components Analyzed

### 1. **Error Analysis**
- Visualizes and quantifies model errors across subgroups
- Helps identify systemic issues and underperforming data segments

### 2. **InterpretML**
- Provides model interpretability using SHAP, LIME, and glass-box methods
- Offers global and local explanations of predictions

### 3. **Fairlearn**
- Measures and mitigates bias in classification and regression models
- Supports fairness-aware model selection

### 4. **Counterfactual Analysis**
- Generates synthetic data points by changing specific feature values
- Helps test "what-if" scenarios for fairness and robustness

### 5. **Causal Inference**
- Identifies causal relationships instead of correlations
- Useful in treatment-effect modeling and decision-making
