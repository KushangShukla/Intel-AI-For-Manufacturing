## 🚀 Capstone Project – [AI-Based Accident Prevention in Modular Manufacturing Systems](https://github.com/KushangShukla/AI-Based-Accident-Prevention-in-MMS-Modular-Manufacturing-System)

**Organization:** International Automobile Centre of Excellence, Ahmedabad  
**Group ID:** G00126  
**Category:** Industry Defined Problem  

### 📌 Description
Accidents in Modular Manufacturing Systems (MMS) often occur due to delayed human response or oversight. By implementing an AI-powered camera vision system, activities can be continuously monitored and machines can be auto-stopped in real-time upon detecting potential hazards. This proactive approach significantly improves workplace safety.

### 🔧 Project Features
- Real-time helmet and human detection using **YOLOv8**
- **Streamlit** interface for interactive safety monitoring
- Logic to auto-stop machine when a human is detected
- Full event logging and model retraining capability
