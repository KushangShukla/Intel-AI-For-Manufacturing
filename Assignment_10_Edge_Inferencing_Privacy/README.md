# Assignment 10 – Edge Inferencing for Privacy-Preserving AI in Manufacturing Health Devices

This assignment examines how edge inferencing enables real-time AI predictions on manufacturing health monitoring devices while ensuring sensitive user data remains secure and private.

---

## 🧠 Objective

To analyze the benefits of edge inferencing for AI-based health monitors in manufacturing and explain how it balances **performance**, **latency**, and **data privacy** in industrial environments.

---

## 📌 Scenario Overview

A manufacturing company has deployed health monitoring devices to improve product accuracy using real-time machine learning models. However, data privacy concerns restrict cloud usage. The company aims to shift computation to the **edge** to mitigate these concerns.

## 🔍 Key Discussion Points

### 1. **What is Edge Inferencing?**
- AI predictions made locally on the device (not on the cloud).
- Utilizes lightweight models optimized for real-time inference.

### 2. **Why Use Edge AI in Health Monitoring?**
- Low latency – faster decision-making
- Offline availability – uninterrupted functionality
- Data privacy – sensitive data never leaves the device
- Reduced bandwidth – less dependency on cloud infrastructure

### 3. **How It Works**
- Train model in the cloud → Compress and export to edge → Run inference on device (e.g., microcontroller, Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson)

### 4. **Privacy Preservation Strategies**
- No transmission of personally identifiable data
- Encryption for local storage
- GDPR-compliant local logs
- Federated learning for decentralized model improvement
